# Memory Card

This project is a part of the [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com) course on React as a practical [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) to implement basic React concepts (useEffect hook in particular).

This is a memory game where a user selects one card after another. The goal is to never pick the same card twice. When the game ends it displays the score. Also the app keeps the best score for a set of games. 

Live version of the project can be found [here](https://mountainflocksmemorycard.netlify.app).
